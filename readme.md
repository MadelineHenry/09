Creation of website with 10 pieces of art ...

## Project infos 

- **Duration**: 4 days
- **Deadline**: 13 novembre 2020
- **Team challenge**: solo 

## What is this project about :grey_question:

This is a web development exercise carried out with the BECODE training to learn various aspects and coding techniques. Here there will be HTML at the end, CSS according to everyone's preferences, one of Frameworks as you want for learn to use them and mainly JavaScript.

## Objectif

- Gather 10 pieces of art (I chose different paintings)
- Create a page in the form of a grid with 4 columns and each work is displayed as a map.

=> The challenge is to generate a map with JavaScript to lighten the HTML file and create an automatism at the level of the maps. 

### Pre-requisite :bowtie:

What you need to get started ...

- basics in **HTML**
- basics in **CSS**
- basics in **JavaScript**
- be ready to learn a Framework (In my case : I used **BULMA**)
- Top work mates or a good ability to do internet research on your own :muscle: 

## What did I learn ?

- Create HTML code
- Generating JavaScript code from HTML code
- Targeting elements in HTML
- Create an array
- Using Framework (BULMA)
- What is a DOM
etc.

## Strength

- I learned intensively through this exercise and these difficulties.
- The result is rather nice, when you have never done this before in your life and the coding is all new to you.
- Using Framework is easy.

## Weaknesse

- I didn't have a basic knowledge of JavaSript ...:disappointed:
So it was hard for me to know which way to go.
- I needed more time to finish the project 

## Advice

Frameworks can make your life easier, but they can also make it more complicated.

Remember to master HTML to make sure that some things in the framework are useful. The strength of an HTLM is in its clarity so always be efficient and concise.
